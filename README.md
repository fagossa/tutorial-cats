Tutorial cats
======

Your job is to make all the test *green*!

Notice that:

> Cats implicits for a given type follow this convention `import cats.instances.mytype._`

> Cats syntax for a given type follow this convention `import cats.syntax.atype._`


## TODO `01` - `Eq`

Comparing with `Eq`, `===` and `=!=`

```
~testOnly example.EqSpec
```


## TODO `02` - `Printable`

Implement the printable for `Gato` (spanish for `Cat`).

`cats` usually split `typeclasses` in the following way:

* A trait defining the general behavior
* A companion object that contains the type classes
* A syntax object containing `implicit class(es)`

```
~testOnly example.PrintableSpec
```


## TODO `03` - `Monoid`

Monoids can `combine` two elements of the same type (thanks to `semigroup`) and have an `empty` element.

> `|+|` is an alias for `combine` present in semigroup

```
~testOnly example.MonoidSpec
```

## TODO `04` - `Functor`

Playing with Functors.

> Functors can `map` over something

```
~testOnly example.FunctorSpec
```


## TODO `05` - `Write and Read`

Handling additional information to the main logic flow.

> Write monad add additional information

> Read monad expects contextual information

```
~testOnly example.WriteAndReadSpec
```


## TODO `06` - `State`

Solving equations.

> State Monad cumulates values

```
~testOnly example.StateSpec
```


## TODO `07` - `Validation`

> Validation Monad and Either Monad handle errors

```
~testOnly example.ValidationSpec
```

# Problems?

If you are really, really, really having problems finding the right imports just include the following

```
import cats._
import cats.implicits._
```

However one of the goals of this exercise is to be able to __identify where the typeclass implementation is located__.
